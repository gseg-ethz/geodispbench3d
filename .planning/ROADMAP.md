# Roadmap: geodispbench3d — Publication Readiness

## Overview

This milestone takes the existing, already-working `geodispbench3d` codebase from "works for
us" to publication-ready on public PyPI. The work sequences strictly: an audit produces a
findings report; targeted fixes are scoped from that report; CLI surfaces are hardened and the
F2S3 adapter is showcased as the canonical `CliToolAdapter` example; licensing, metadata, and
packaging are reconciled for public distribution; and finally CI/CD automation and trusted
publishing close the loop.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Code-Health Audit** - Read-only audit producing a written findings report that gates all subsequent work (completed 2026-06-26)
- [x] **Phase 2: Targeted Fixes** - Apply audit-scoped fixes until the full test and quality-tool suite passes (completed 2026-06-27)
- [x] **Phase 3: CLI Hardening** - Harden all three CLI surfaces; document F2S3 as the canonical CliToolAdapter example (completed 2026-06-27)
- [x] **Phase 4: Licensing, Metadata & Packaging** - Reconcile license, drop Private classifier, untangle packaging deps; resolve open iof3d/pchandler decisions (completed 2026-06-27)
- [ ] **Phase 5: CI/CD & Release** - Automate lint/type/test gates, wheel+sdist build, and trusted-publishing release to public PyPI

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Code-Health Audit

**Goal**: A structured findings report exists that classifies every code-health concern and authorises (or defers) each fix before any code changes land
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: AUDIT-01, AUDIT-02, AUDIT-03, AUDIT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A written report enumerates all bloat, dead code, and duplication found across `src/`
  2. Each of the three architecture-flagged anti-patterns (untyped `SuiteConfig`, duplicated `SweepParameter` coercion, duplicated `_parser_fn_repr`) is evaluated and given a disposition
  3. The three CLI surfaces (`cli.py`, `CliToolAdapter`, F2S3 `conda-run`) each have a focused risk assessment in the report
  4. Every finding carries a severity rating and one of: fix / defer / accept

**Plans**: 2/2 plans complete
**Wave 1**

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Run the locked detector set (vulture/coverage/deptry/radon) via the conda env, capture reproducible evidence, and distill EVIDENCE.md

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Reasoned manual file:line review (incl. design-sensibility D-07 + CONCERNS re-verify) and assemble the single severity-classified, disposition-recommended REPORT.md

### Phase 2: Targeted Fixes

**Goal**: All audit-mandated fixes are applied, dead code is removed, and the full quality-tool suite (ruff, pyright, pytest) passes cleanly
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: FIX-01, FIX-02, FIX-03, FIX-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Every finding tagged "fix" in the audit report is resolved in an atomic, reviewed commit
  2. Dead code and unused bloat identified by the audit is absent from `src/`
  3. `SweepParameter` construction is handled by a single source (e.g. `from_mapping` classmethod); `_parser_fn_repr` lives in one shared location, not two
  4. `ruff`, `pyright`, and the full `pytest` suite (core, iof3d, f2s3) pass without errors after every fix lands

**Plans**: 7/7 plans complete

**Wave 0** *(test net + pyright baseline — D-04 tests-first)*

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — F-20 runner.py characterization net (fake AxClient + stub adapter; the regression anchor)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — F-21 store + F-22 evaluation failure-path tests + pyright baseline & reusable baseline-diff gate (pyright_gate.py)

**Wave 1** *(blocked on Wave 0)*

- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — F-01 typed SuiteConfig + F-13 provenance fold + F-05 finite-case surfacing
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — F-02 SweepParameter.from_mapping dedup (parallel; disjoint files)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 02-03)*

- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — F-08 narrowed excepts + typed PassDiagnostics + non_fatal_failures on every summary + CLI summary line

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 02-05)*

- [x] 02-06-PLAN.md — F-09/F-10/F-11 mechanical hygiene cluster (timestamps, import hoist, dead asdict)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on 02-04 + 02-06)*

- [x] 02-07-PLAN.md — F-03 parser_fn_repr dedup + F-30 dead-field deletion/guards + final FIX-04 gate

### Phase 3: CLI Hardening

**Goal**: All three CLI surfaces handle failures predictably and F2S3 is documented as the canonical CliToolAdapter example (subprocess + conda-run pattern)
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: CLI-01, CLI-02, CLI-03, CLI-04, CLI-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The package CLI (`run` / `rescore` / `analyze` / `dashboard` / `list-metrics`) validates arguments and exits with documented non-zero codes on error
  2. `CliToolAdapter` has a written subprocess contract covering: nonzero tool exit, missing output files, and timeout — all surface as clear failures, not silent data corruption
  3. The F2S3 `conda-run` integration detects a missing env or missing binary and emits an actionable error message
  4. Tests cover the hardened CLI behaviours: invalid arguments, exit codes, adapter failure modes
  5. F2S3 is documented as the canonical `CliToolAdapter` example, including a "how to obtain F2S3" note sourced from the gseg-ethz F2S3 repo for the case where F2S3 is not bundled in-env

**Open question for Phase 3 discussion:** F2S3 binary in-env vs subprocess/`conda-run` — **resolved (CONTEXT D-01): document both, default `conda run`** (F2S3 stays the subprocess + env-isolation showcase; in-env override documented).

**Plans**: 4/4 plans complete

**Wave 1**

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Adapter contract & tool-config hardening: timeout (F-32), stdout_json→glob deprecation + empty-glob failure (F-07), env/binary preflight + ToolPreflightError (F-16)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 03-01)*

- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — CLI surface: rescore subcommand split (D-09), 0/1/2 exit-code taxonomy + F-06 fix, clean-error wrapper (D-11), `--timeout` wiring

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 03-01 + 03-02)*

- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — CLI-04 tests: net-new `tests/core/test_cli.py` (stub executables, main()-level exit codes, adapter contract)
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — CLI-05 docs: F2S3 canonical example + how-to-obtain, subprocess contract + exit-code taxonomy, rescore migration note, schema reference

### Phase 4: Licensing, Metadata & Packaging

**Goal**: The package is legally and structurally ready for public PyPI distribution — license statements consistent, Private classifier removed, and the F2S3 extra installable without the iof3d extra
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: LIC-01, LIC-02, LIC-03, LIC-04, PKG-01, PKG-02, PKG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. README, `pyproject.toml`, and `LICENSE` are consistent: all say BSD-3-Clause; no "Proprietary" language and no `Private :: Do Not Upload` classifier remain
  2. Package metadata (description, project URLs, authors, supported-Python classifiers) is complete and accurate for a public release
  3. `CITATION.cff` and any docs reflect the public BSD-3-Clause status
  4. Installing `geodispbench3d[f2s3]` resolves `pchandler` correctly without depending on the `iof3d` extra; `pchandler`'s new PyPI release is confirmed non-breaking (or the usage is adapted)

**Open questions for Phase 4 discussion:**

- Resolve `pchandler` for the F2S3 parser via the `f2s3` extra vs a `pchandler`-free example parser
- Ship `geodispbench3d_iof3d` and the `iof3d-ax` script in the public distribution, or exclude them

**Both resolved in 04-CONTEXT.md:** (D-01) single wheel, ship `geodispbench3d_iof3d` dormant via a PEP 562 import guard + graceful `iof3d-ax` launcher; (D-05) add `pchandler ~= 2.1` to the `f2s3` extra (F2S3 stays fully runnable).

**Plans**: 2/2 plans complete

**Wave 1**

- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Licensing & metadata reconciliation: README License (Proprietary → BSD-3-Clause) + no-timeline `[iof3d]` note, `pyproject.toml` classifiers (drop `Private`, add Beta/audience/topic) + Documentation/Changelog URLs, confirm `CITATION.cff`/`LICENSE` (LIC-01…04)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 04-01 — shared `pyproject.toml`)*

- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Packaging & dormant-iof3D guard: comment `iof3d` extra + `f2s3 = ["pchandler ~= 2.1"]`, PEP 562 `__getattr__` guard in `geodispbench3d_iof3d/__init__.py` + `cli.py` launcher split, conftest skip-message fix (PKG-01…03)

### Phase 5: CI/CD & Release

**Goal**: An automated pipeline validates code quality on every push and publishes verified releases to public PyPI via trusted publishing
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: CICD-01, CICD-02, CICD-03, CICD-04, PROT-01, DOCS-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. CI runs ruff (lint), pyright (type check), and the full test matrix on Python 3.12 on every push and pull request
  2. CI builds wheel + sdist and the distribution passes `twine check` before any publish step can proceed
  3. A tagged release triggers OIDC trusted publishing to public PyPI — no stored long-lived tokens are used
  4. release-please is wired end-to-end so version bumps, changelog entries, and PyPI publishes flow automatically from a git tag

**Open question for Phase 5 discussion (raised in Phase 2):** Type-checking strategy — keep `pyright` as the enforced CI type gate, or demote pyright to informative and adopt a strict `mypy` gate (pchandler-style), realigning the CI lint workflow accordingly. Pros/cons to be discussed here; **not pre-decided**. Carried from Phase 2's "pyright is RED at HEAD" finding — see `.planning/phases/02-targeted-fixes/02-RESEARCH.md` Assumption A1 and Phase 2 CONTEXT.md D-13.

**CI-health evidence (flagged 2026-06-27, Phase 3 ship of PR #3):** The CI Lint job runs **raw `pyright`** (exit 1 on any error) and is **red on every run** — `develop` pushes and the Phase 1, 2, and 3 PRs all merged with it red. The standing baseline is **14 errors, 22 warnings**, dominated by unresolved plugin imports (`iof3D` / `pchandler` / `pc2img`, which CI does not install) plus a few pre-existing type-narrowing errors. Because `Test` and `Build wheel + install smoke` are gated behind Lint via `needs:`, **the entire test/build matrix is skipped on every PR** — so success criterion #1 above is currently unmet in practice. GSD phases gate locally on a pyright **baseline-diff** (no NEW errors vs `develop`), not green CI; Phase 3 was diff-clean (same 14/22). Greening this gate before the public release is the concrete work item here — options: baseline-aware pyright, scope pyright to core + exclude uninstalled-plugin imports, install the `iof3d` extra in CI, or the mypy-swap above. Decoupling `Test`/`Build` from the Lint gate is a related sub-decision so type-check policy does not silently mask test regressions.

**Plans**: 2/6 plans executed

**Wave 1**

- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: Python 3.12-only migration, genuine 0-error pyright (scope + fix residual core errors), and source-of-truth updates (REQUIREMENTS/ROADMAP/PROJECT/STATE; add PROT-01/DOCS-01; relabel milestone v0.2)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 05-01)*

- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Docs scaffold: docs/source/ Sphinx+myst over the existing Markdown, minimal conf.py, .readthedocs.yaml (DOCS-01)
- [ ] 05-03-PLAN.md — Release path: publish-pypi.yml + publish-testpypi.yml (OIDC), release-please.yml rewrite (workflow_run + App token, v5), v0.2.0 seeding (CICD-03/04)
- [ ] 05-04-PLAN.md — Branch protection: protect-main/protect-develop ruleset payloads + apply script + docs, enabled at ship (PROT-01)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 05-01 + 05-02)*

- [ ] 05-05-PLAN.md — CI restructure: lint ‖ 3.12 test matrix, build needs:[test], docs-build job, SHA pins, setup-python-deps composite, check_publish_gate.py (CICD-01/02)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on 05-03 + 05-05)*

- [ ] 05-06-PLAN.md — Integration verification: real CI run green + TestPyPI OIDC dry-run + external-prereq human gate (CICD-01/02/03 proof)
